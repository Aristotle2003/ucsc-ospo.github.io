Welcome to my OSRE 2025 profile!  
This reflects my current interests and ongoing work.  
**For the latest updates, visit my [homepage](https://prathameshdevadiga.vercel.app/).**

I am currently a final year B.Tech Computer Science student at [PES University](https://www.pes.edu), Bangalore.  
My research interests include Trustworthy AI, AI Safety & Alignment, deep learning, vector search, and large-scale Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  
As part of OSRE 2025, I’m building a billion-scale open-source vector embedding dataset to benchmark ANN algorithms and support real-world retrieval systems.

In my free time, I enjoy mentoring, experimenting with open-source tools, and exploring system internals.  
You’ll also find me vibing to music, diving into sci-fi shows, or geeking out over futuristic tech ideas.
